# Personally

This is a client app for the [personally-api](https://github.com/fif4evr/personally-api).  
It only runs locally for now.  
To run it, you'll need nodejs installed.  If you have that, clone the repo, then run locally:

```
npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You'll also need to be running Personally-api locally.

You can then navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser, and see the results.
